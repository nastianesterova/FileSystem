Set of c programs to execute each function

a. One that creates a disk file system and shows that it is the correct size
mkdisk.c calls pdos_mkdisk, passing it the size of the disk described in project description.
Uses stat struct to print size of memory.
instructions to run this test:
    ./mkdisk

b. One that formats and initializes the disk by writing the FS structure
mkfs.c can take an ID string as a parameter, but also has default ID which it pases into pdos_mkfs
to initialize the file system.
instructions to run this test:
    ./mkfs

c. One that uses the above FS and creates a test file (file1.txt) in the root directory.
Writes out 1023 bytes of A-Z repeatedly. Writes out 1024 bytes of A-Z repeatedly.
write_file.c takes several parameters:
1. filename
2. int to indicate how many bytes to write to file (0 = 1023 bytes, 1 = 1024 bytes)
instructions to run this test:
    ./write_file file1.txt    //will write 1023 bytes A-Z
    ./write_file file1.txt 1  //will write 1024 bytes A-Z

d. One that reads in the data from above file and prints it out ensuring it matches
can use either print_file.c or read_from_file.c
read_from_file.c:
    parameters:
        filename
    what it does:
        reads from file "filename" and compares each byte to characters A-Z in a loop until EOF is reached
        if there were no mismatches, prints success messages
        if an error was found, prints what the mismatch was and returns -1
instructions to run this test:
    ./read_from_file file1.txt

e. Repeat (c), this time create a second file file2.txt after (i). Now expand the original (file1.txt) file
by writing out another 1024 bytes.
instructions to run this test:
    ./write_file file2.txt    //creates file2.txt and fills with 1023 bytes
    ./write_file file1.txt 1 expand   //expands file1.txt with 1024 bytes (to expand needs to read file
    so that pos is at end of file, and also finds the last char so it continues writing from the char in
    alphabet from which it left off)


f. Print out the contents of file1.txt and file2.txt
instructions to run this test:
    ./print_file file1.txt
    ./print_file file2.txt

g. Does directory listing of root directory
instructions to run this test:
    ./list_dir
